REQUIREMENTS
------------
This module requires Drupal 6.x and PHP 5.2.x (or newer).


INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called
     sites/all/modules/timecert/ under your Drupal installation directory.

  2. Go to [Administer >> Site building >> Modules] and enable the TimeCert
     module. You will find it in the section labelled "Other".

  3. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> TimeCert] to review and
     change the configuration options to your liking.

  4. Run Drupal's cron maintenance task (e.g. http://example.org/cron.php)
     to timestamp already existing content. You may need to run this
     multiple times until all content has been timestamped.

     Alternatively, you can just let content (of the TimeCert-enabled
     content types configured in the previous step) get timestamped the
     first time that it is viewed.

  5. (See README.txt for information on submitting bug reports.)


SEE ALSO
--------

  * For evidential and verification purposes it may be useful to keep an
    easily-accessible permanent archive of the input data to the timestamped
    digest. Therefore the module integrates with the Bitcache data storage
    system (if installed) for purposes of storing the input texts to the
    SHA-1 hash algorithm used in computing the timestamped digests.
