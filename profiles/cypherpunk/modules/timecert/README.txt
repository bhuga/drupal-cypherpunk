TimeCert for Drupal
===================
TimeCert is a web service for timestamping content. This provides evidence
by a trusted third-party that something (e.g. a blog post, a document, or a
file) existed at a given time. TimeCert records and gives you the timestamp
for when someone first referenced a given digital fingerprint.

This module integrates TimeCert into Drupal 6.x by timestamping
administrator-selected Drupal content types based on their full URLs,
providing evidence that a Drupal page existed at a given time.
