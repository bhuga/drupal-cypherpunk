REQUIREMENTS
------------
This module requires Drupal 6.x and PHP 5.2.x (or newer).


INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called
     sites/all/modules/lockdown/ under your Drupal installation directory.

  2. Go to [Administer >> Site building >> Modules] and enable the Lockdown
     module. You will find it in the section labelled 'Security'. (Also
     enable any of Lockdown's submodules that you find relevant.)

  3. Go to [Administer >> User management >> Permissions] to configure the
     module's permissions.

     WARNING: Be careful to whom you give out the "administer lockdown"
     privilege! Users with this permission can circumvent Lockdown's
     security policies, so do be sure that you trust both their integrity
     and competence.

  4. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Lockdown] to review and
     change the module's configuration options.

     By default, two lockdown levels have been created for you when
     installing this module: 'Online' and 'Offline'. Feel free to delete
     these if you wish to create customized lockdown levels. (Note that the
     currently-active lockdown level can't be deleted, so if you wish to
     delete the default lockdown levels, you must first create a new custom
     level and activate it.)

  5. If you have installed the Rules module (which is highly recommended),
     go to [Administer >> Rules >> Rule sets] to configure the actions
     executed when the lockdown level is changed. This module provides a
     default rule set for each lockdown level that you create.

     WARNING: Given that this module adds several powerful but potentially
     dangerous Rules actions (including one to erase the Drupal database!),
     you may wish to exercise a certain prudence in granting the "administer
     rules" privilege to users.

  6. (See README.txt for information on submitting bug reports.)

  * The Rules module unlocks the full power of Lockdown by enabling you to
    configure conditionally-executed actions that can be triggered when
    lockdown levels are activated and deactivated:

  * The Messaging Framework allows Lockdown alerts to be sent out using
    XMPP, SMS or Twitter, in addition to e-mail:

    <http://drupal.org/project/messaging>

  * The OpenPGP and GnuPG modules provide PGP-compatible encryption for
    Drupal's outgoing e-mails:

    <http://drupal.org/project/openpgp>
    <http://drupal.org/project/gnupg>

  * The Bitcache distributed storage system makes it trivial to quickly and
    securely disseminate data through a private network of Drupal sites:

    <http://drupal.org/project/bitcache>

  * The Secure Pages module ensures that important pages on your Drupal site
    are always used only over an SSL-secured connection instead of plain old
    unencrypted HTTP:

    <http://drupal.org/project/securepages>

  * The Password Policy module makes sure that the users of your Drupal site
    use sufficiently strong passwords so as to lessen the threat of
    inadvertent user account compromise:
