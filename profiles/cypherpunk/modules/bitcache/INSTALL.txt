REQUIREMENTS
------------
This module requires Drupal 6.x and PHP 5.2.x (or newer).


INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called
     sites/all/modules/bitcache/ under your Drupal installation directory.

  2. Go to [Administer >> Site building >> Modules] and enable the Bitcache
     module. You will find it in the section labelled "Other".

     change the configuration options to your liking.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

  * Global Redirect compatibility: don't enable the "Deslash" option if you
    wish to use Bitcache's HTTP API bitstream index (at bitcache/).


SEE ALSO
--------

  * File Framework builds upon Bitcache to provide a comprehensive document
    and media management system for Drupal:

    <http://drupal.org/project/fileframework>

  * The Bitcache standalone command-line tools can be used to replicate
    Bitcache repositories between Drupal instances as well as to a number of
    other storage backends such as Amazon S3:
