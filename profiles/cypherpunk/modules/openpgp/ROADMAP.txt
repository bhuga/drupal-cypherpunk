This is a listing of known bugs, features that mostly work but are still
somewhat in progress, features that are being considered or planned for
implementation, and just miscellaneous far-out ideas that could, in
principle, be implemented if someone had the time and inclination to do so.

(NOTE: there is no guarantee any of these items will, in fact, be
implemented, nor should any possible scheduling indications be construed as
promises under any circumstances. TANSTAAFL. If you absolutely need
something implemented right now, please contact the developers to see if
they're available for contract work, or whether a modest donation could
perhaps speed things along.)


KNOWN BUGS
----------
* When "Encrypt outgoing e-mail" is set to "Always" and a user saves their
  profile, any previous customization of their user-specific encryption
  toggle gets lost (because the checkbox is disabled and always results in a
  value of "0").


TODO
----
* Implement OpenPGP key storage based on Bitcache.
* Implement support for the OpenPGP HTTP Keyserver Protocol (HKP).
* Implement support for the OpenPGP Extensions for HTTP and Enigform:
  <http://enigform.mozdev.org/>


2.0
---
* Implement asymmetric OpenPGP encryption requiring no other
  dependencies beyond PHP with the OpenSSL extension, based on:
  <http://github.com/bendiken/openpgp>
