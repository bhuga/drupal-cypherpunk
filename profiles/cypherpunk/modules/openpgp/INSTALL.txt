REQUIREMENTS
------------
This module requires Drupal 6.x and PHP 5.2.x (or newer) as well as a recent
1.x or 2.x version (1.4.7 and newer should work, as should 2.0.12 or newer)
of the GnuPG command-line tools; these must be installed on the web server
by the system administrator as described in GnuPG's documentation:

  <http://www.gnupg.org/>


INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Ensure that the GnuPG command-line tools are installed on your server.

  2. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called
     sites/all/modules/openpgp/ under your Drupal installation directory.

  3. Go to [Administer >> Site building >> Modules] and enable the "OpenPGP"
     and "OpenPGP with GnuPG" modules. You will find them in the section
     labelled "Cryptography".

  4. Go to [Administer >> User management >> Profiles] and create a new
     multi-line textfield that will be used to store your users' public
     keys. You can title and name this field anything you want; however, if
     in doubt, use the following settings:

       Category:    Contact details
       Title:       PGP public key
       Form name:   profile_openpgp_key
       Visibility:  Public field, content shown on profile page but not used
                    on member list pages.

  5. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Cryptography] to review and
     change the e-mail encryption configuration options to your liking.

     Also, in the section labelled "Public key storage", select the profile
     field you created in the previous step.

     (NOTE: to change any of the OpenPGP settings here, you must either be
     the Drupal superadministrator or have the "administer OpenPGP
     configuration" permission granted to you.)

  6. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Cryptography >> GnuPG] to
     review and change the GNU Privacy Guard configuration options to your
     liking.

     In order for encryption to work at all, you must, at a minimum, here
     input the correct path where the `gpg' binary is installed on your
     server, as well as correctly configure (or create, if it doesn't exist)
     the GnuPG home directory. (For the latter task, please refer to the
     GnuPG documentation.)

  7. Go to [Administer >> Reports >> Status report] and check under the
     header "OpenPGP implementation" that your GnuPG installation was
     correctly detected and that the GnuPG version number is displayed
     without any associated warnings or errors.

  8. (See README.txt for information on submitting bug reports.)


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Any encryption errors are logged to Drupal's watchdog log and will contain
the GnuPG output for the command that failed. Here follow some common
problematic scenarios and tips on troubleshooting them:

  * gpg: Fatal: can't create directory `sites/all/modules/openpgp/.gnupg': \
         No such file or directory

    If you are getting the above error despite being certain that the GnuPG
    home directory in question already exists, try replacing the relative
    directory path at <admin/settings/openpgp/gpg> with the full absolute
    path to the directory in question.
