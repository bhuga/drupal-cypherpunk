OpenPGP for Drupal
==================
OpenPGP is the most widely-used e-mail encryption standard in the world.
Originally derived from PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), first created by Phil
Zimmermann in 1991, the standard is now defined by the IETF in RFC 4880.

This module provides encryption for Drupal's outgoing e-mails using GNU
Privacy Guard (GnuPG), an open-source implementation of the OpenPGP
standard.
